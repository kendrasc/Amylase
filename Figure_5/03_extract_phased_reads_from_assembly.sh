#This script maps the contigs to the reference genome hg38. Then, it gets the coordinates for the region of interest (AMY region), 
#and extracts the reads that make up those contigs. Because hifiasm phased the contigs based on the trios, this is a way of getting the 
#phased reads for the amylase region. The contigs were manually checked to make sure they are encompassing the amy region (please see dotplots).
