# Files in this folder

Here is a description for all the files in this folder. Link to all softwares used are within each script. 

01_read_correction_dorado.sh: pipeline used for read correction for the long reads generated by ONT. 

02_assembly_hifiasm.sh: pipeline for assembly used for each of the samples in this project. This step was important for phasing the reads. 

03_extract_phased_reads_from_assembly.sh: hifiasm generates phased assemblies. This is the pipeline used to retrieve the phased reads that made up the contigs that span the Amylase region of interest. 

04_dotplots_hg38.sh: this is the pipeline used to visualize the contigs that span the AMY region for each of the phased regions. This was used to generate Figure S7. 

05_mapping_phased_reads_haplotypes_and_getting_read_depths.sh: This is the pipeline used to map all the phased reads (already extracted from contigs) to the 40 haplotypes used as reference and already published by Yilmaz et al. (2024) and Bolognini et al. (2024).

haplotypes_for_mapping.zip: all fasta files used as reference for mapping the reads. These were taken from Yilmaz et al. (2024) and Bolognini et al. (2024).

mock_H7.fa: fasta file of the mock H7 haplotype generated from the Peruvian H9 haplotype.

pangenomes.sh: pipeline used to generate the pangenome from the same haplotypes (haplotypes_for_mapping.zip).
